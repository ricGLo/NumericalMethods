# Numerical Methods

This repository contains some numerical methods including optimization methods that I've implemented during my collage courses. The majority of them are explained and implemented in jupyter notebooks. I've not uploaded all numerical methods I've implemented, since I would like to simplified some of them. Explanations in jupyter notebooks are in spanish but I will be translating them soon. In this way, hopefully there will be two versions of each jupyter notebook in the repository.

## Gaussian Quadrature for double and tripe integrals

This is my final project of the numerical methods collage course. Here, I explain the theory of Gaussian Quadrature and implement Gaussian Quadrature to approximate numerically double and triple integrals. I will make a version of this project in english as soon as possible.

## Nelder Mead Method

This is my final project of the optimization collage course. I explain how the Nelder Mead method works and I implement it in the [jupyter notebook](/src/NelderMead/NelderMeadMethod.ipynb). Again, I will make a version of the notebook in english. The notebook uses [this pdf](/src/NelderMead/N-M.pdf) as a tool to explain how the Nelder Mead algorithm take decisions en each iteration. If you only wish to see the implementation of the method you can see the function in [this python file](/src/NelderMead/Nel-Mead.py).
